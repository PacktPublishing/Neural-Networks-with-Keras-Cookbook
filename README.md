## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
data['DebtRatio_newoutlier']=np.where(data['DebtRatio']>1,1,0)
data['DebtRatio']=np.where(data['DebtRatio']>1,1,data['DebtRatio'])

```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
This intermediate-level book targets beginners and intermediate-level machine learning practitioners and data scientists who have just started their journey with neural networks. This book is for those who are looking for resources to help them navigate through the various neural network architectures; you'll build multiple architectures, with concomitant case studies ordered by the complexity of the problem. A basic understanding of Python programming and a familiarity with basic machine learning are all you need to get started with this book.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-16).
